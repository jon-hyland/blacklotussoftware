1. INTRODUCTION

This is the documentation included with Net Creeper v1.5, the first complete build of the software.  The primary earlier version wasn't quite complete, and therefore wasn't distributed much.  Changes to this version include full functionality, improvements to button graphics, a total font change, minor bug fixes and most important, refined code for much faster performance when browsing pages and switching forms.  This project was started in the fall of '99, worked on for about two weeks and then mostly forgotten.  In the last week (Feb. '00) I've decided to crack down and finish it.  The final changes took about three days to complete.


2. WHAT IS NET CREEPER

Net Creeper is a new and cool web browser brought to you by Black Lotus Software,  the world's greatest supplier of awesome freeware products.  Net Creeper has a cool and entertaining user interface, with very useful and simple controls.  Navigation is easy in both normal and fullscreen mode.  It offers quick buttons for your personal favorite homepage, your best search site and your own web email site.  Also features an easily customizable favorites list.  Options include ability to start browser at homepage, search site, email site or the last site visited on previous use.  Many other great features are included.  This product is eye-candy compared to the Internet Explorer.


3. INSPIRATION FOR NET CREEPER

I was always telling myself how much I hated the Internet Explorer interface.  In my opinion it is ugly and inconvenient.  There are too many nasty and useless menus and not enough worthwhile functionality.  I decided to write my own web browser with my own interface and browsing options.  Since writing your own HTML page builder is almost impossible, I had to use a component of IE to actually to that work.  However all the controls, the navigation methods, the web-site tracking and everything that makes the program work is all designed and written by me.  Making this project was fun because I was able to get creative with the look and feel of it all.


4. HOW DO I USE IT?

The basic navigation controls are very similar to Internet Explorer.  You must already be connected to an internet service provider (ISP).  Once you have established a connection to the internet, launch Net Creeper from the Black Lotus Software program folder that was created on your Start menu.

Once connection to the internet is established and Net Creeper is launched, you will start at one of four pages.  These consist of: Your Homepage, Your Search Page, Your Mail Page, or The Site You Last Visited.  You have the ability to change the address of any of the first three options to whatever sites you prefer.  

The following example tells you how to change the address of one of your quick-link sites:
1] Navigate to the site (www.whatever-it-is.com).
2] Click on the Drag-to-Set icon (it looks like a dagger), and drag it to the appropriate button and release.
3] Click YES on the menu warning you to change you quick-link. That's it.
4] Optionally, you can open the Settings and Options Menu by clicking on the spider logo.
5] Edit the text box for the appropriate quick-link site and click OK.

To add a site to your favorites list, follow steps 1 - 3 above.

Click on Fullscreen to enter fullscreen mode.  Fullscreen offers a larger view of the web page and retains most of Net Creepers useful functions (like the address bar).  Internet Explorer doesn't offer this.

Other options are accessible through the Options menu, which you get by clicking on the Net Creeper logo towards the left.
