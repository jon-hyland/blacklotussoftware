1. INTRODUCTION

With Binary Crypt you can take a binary file (any file) and encrypt it to a format that will be virtually impossible to decode.  The size of the output file is only a few bytes more than the original unlike some encryption schemes.  Binary Crypt creates a new coding scheme before encrypting each and every byte of data it encounters.  New with version 1.2 is optional password protection, adding a lot more security to the program.


2. HOW TO INSTALL

Open the .ZIP file with Winzip or similar unzip program.  There will be four install files.:
	- REAME.TXT -- This file.
	- SETUP.EXE -- The executable you run to install.
	- BLSECMESS.CAB -- A compressed file containing the program.
	-SETUP.1ST -- A setup file.
Double-click the SETUP.EXE file and the install wizard will run.  To uninstall the program, open your Control Panel, then Add/Remove Programs.  Select Black Lotus Binary Crypt and click Add/Remove.


3. USAGE

Using Binary Crypt is this simple:  When you start Binary Crypt you are shown the Encrypt menu.  Select an input file and an output file and click the Encrypt button.  If you want to add optional password protection to the file, check the Password Encrypt checkbox before you click Encrypt.  You will be asked for a case-sensitive password of 3-12 characters.  To decrypt a file, move to the Decrypt menu by clicking the Decrypt Menu button or select Menu / Decrypt Menu.  Select an input and an output file and click the Decrypt button.  Binary Crypt uses the .blc extention for it's files.  A file without an internal Binary Crypt tag will not be decrypted.  If you want to decrypt a file, you must know at least the file type of the original file because file names are not internally stored.  If the file was coded with an encrypted password you will be asked to enter it.  Typing a wrong password will still allow the decryption process to occur, only the output file will be hopelessly scrambled.
