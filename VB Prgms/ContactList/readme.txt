1. INTRODUCTION

Contact List is a utility to keep track of people names and phone numbers.  The interface is simple to understand and neat looking.  You can create records, delete or edit records, search for matching entries, sort by name or creation date, etc.  This makes other phone list programs look lame.



2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Copy or extract all the included files to a new folder. Ex: "C:\CONTACT\".  Open the folder and run ContactList.exe.  There might be a few sample records that should be deleted.



3. TROUBLESHOOTING / HINTS

The program works with a file called RECORD.DAT to save settings and the record database.  In the rare case this file becomes corrupt you can change the settings manually.  Open the file with any text editor.  There will be many lines of text containing all saved data. Look below to see what lines pertain to what data items.

LINE 1: Total number of records in database.
	Ex.: 31

LINE 2: Number of record last displayed.  This will be
	shown first when program loads.
	Ex.: 21

LINE 3: First name of first record, enclosed in
	quotation marks.
	Ex.: "Jon"

LINE 4:	Last name of current record, enclosed in
	quotation marks.
	Ex.: "Hyland" or ""

LINE 5: Phone number of current record, enclosed in
	quotation marks.
	Ex.: "(360) 738-0507"

LINE 6: Second phone number or current record, enclosed
	in quotation marks.
	Ex.: "(425) 454-8474" or ""

LINE 7: EMail address of current record, enclosed in
	quotation marks.
	Ex.: "blotusmail@aol.com"

LINE 8: Date and time current record was first created.
	Enclosed with pound sign.
	Ex.: #1999-09-07 04:26:33#


LINES 3 - 7 WILL BE REPEATED AS MANY TIMES AS THERE ARE RECORDS.  MAKE SURE THIS NUMBER CORESPONDS TO LINE #1.
