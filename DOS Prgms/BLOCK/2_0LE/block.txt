I. Overview

   Block Cruncher is a simple, color text game in which the player
 arranges multi-shaped blocks as they fall from the "sky".  It is
 similar in fashion to another popular game for computers and
 video game systems, whose name we shall not mention.  Prepare
 for a game of intense concentration and mind-blowing suspense!


II. Warning!!

   Due to the extreme nature of this game, a higher level of
 mental awareness may result.  Play at own risk.


III. How to Play (In Case You Are an Idiot)

   The object of the game, besides to gain points, is to keep your
 playing area as free of blocks as possible.  The blocks fall from
 above, one at a time, and you are able to control the block until
 it meets its final resting place somewhere at the bottom.  Fill
 an entire horizontal area, and the entire line will disappear as
 if by magic.  Manage to "crunch" multiple lines in one shot and
 watch your score skyrocket!  Your game is over when your pile (not
 your excrement) reaches the top.


IV. Secret Commands/Options

Preview :
   One of the options allowed in the game is the preview of your
 next piece.  This can be toggled ON/OFF with the [T] button.
 Be warned however, this will cost you half of every point value.
 I know you'll try it, but you can't turn it on and then off again,
 you have to wait for the next piece to see the next piece.

Step/Drop :
   By default, when you press [DOWN], your block will instantly
 drop to the bottom.  Pressing [D] will toggle the drop option to OFF
 allowing you to decend the block down in a slower fashion.

Sound :
   If you happen to be one of those tight, constrictive, humorless
 individuals who I happen to dislike, the sound effects may prove
 a bit to anoying for your finely-tuned ears.  In that case, all
 that is required by you is to press the [E] button to toggle
 the sound ON/OFF.
 ** Sound has been disabled in the limited edition of the game **

Speed :
   Although the play speed will increase as you hurtle through the
 point barriors, advanced players might choose to begin the game
 at an increased level.  The magic button [S] will prompt you
 to enter a new speed from 1-10.  Be aware as well that increased
 play speed means increased points.
 ** Speed altering has been disabled in the limited edition **

Reset High Score List :
   Sure it happens.  Eventually somebody, somewhere, will play your
 copy of Block Cruncher and place in your High Score List.  Suppose
 this person is one lacking status in your local social environment.
 Deleting the High Score List by pressing [R] will prevent the
 embarassing possibility that someone else will see that you let 
 him or her play games on your computer.

List High Score List :
   In case you get the urdge to gloat over the High Score List
 in the middle of game play you can do so by pressing [L].

Pause :
   Pooping durring game play is not an option.  In an attempt to
 save your precious undergarment, a Pause option has been included
 to allow for multiple(?) bathroom breaks.

New Game :
   Losers and weenies can give up by pressing [N] for a new game.
 Winners will continue to play because their cool.
