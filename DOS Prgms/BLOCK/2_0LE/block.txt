I. Overview

   Block Cruncher is a simple, color text game similar to Tetris.


II. Warning!!

   Due to the extreme nature of this game, play at your own risk.


III. How to Play

 The object of the game, besides to gain points, is to keep your
 playing area as free of blocks as possible.  The blocks fall from
 above, one at a time, and you are able to control the block until
 it meets its final resting place somewhere at the bottom.  Fill
 an entire horizontal area, and the entire line will disappear.  
 Manage to "crunch" multiple lines in one shot for higher reward.
 The game is over when the pile reaches the top.
