                           NOTES FOR COOLDRAW V2.2

 I ended up writing Cooldraw to help in designing the graphics for some DOS text games.  It creates pages eighty by twenty-four characters across in sixteen color.  Many features are supported including Cut, Fill, Move, Change, Flip and Spill.  You position characters, select areas to move or change, etc.  Best feature is the smooth, easy layout and look.  Check it out.

If you encounter any problems running this program, try reinstalling on C: drive.  There are a few picture files included, some of which I used in game design.

LEGAL NOTEICE : This program is freeware and can be distributed freely.  The Pascal source code is included and can be modified, providing no credit is claimed for said work.  If you try you will be found and beaten.
