DELUXE BUG ZAPPER SCREENSAVER

This is a fun little program I wrote back in Febuary of '97.  It was the third in a series of bug-zapping screensavers that I made just out of boredom between 95 and 97.  I had completely forgotten about it until I was looting through my old Pascal folder and found it.   Believe it or not this entire program was written in 42.0 minutes.  The bug zapper is pleasently fun to watch and maybe even stress-relieving.  I'm making no claims.
