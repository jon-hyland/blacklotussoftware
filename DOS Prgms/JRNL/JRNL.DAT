JRNL 07/18/95
Painted walls at WCC alone. Chris was at D.Q.
Finished v1.0 of Journal.
It's 95 degrees in here. (It was 8pm when I wrote this)
Tried to call Mr Mellema for drivers ed certificate but he
 wasn't home.
Fixed TextCode and made it better. Now it codes/decodes
 automatically. No /c or /d switches.
Started Journal 1.1. You can press Esc and BckSp in AskDate
 now. Had to make a second array with [1..8] of Char for
 it to work.
My right wrist hurts from typing. I won't make work on
 J v1.1 anymore tonight (its only 10:30pm).
 
 
 
JRNL 07/19/95
Went to work. Painted walls all day with Chris. Didn't go
 to lunch anywhere because we both brought food. Some
 old lady wanted my phone number because she wanted us
 to paint her house or something. If she ever calls we'll
 just take a look at what she wants and name a price. If
 she won't pay that much then who cares. Neither of us
 really need the extra money.
Got a haircut after work. Mom bought me a new pair of shoes
 to.
DJ called and told about Mt StHellens trip this weekend.
 Theres a meeting tomorrow about it.
Went to church video training.
Worked on J1.1. Made (Enter) push lines down unless not
 enough space or don't need to. Still have to fix (BckSp)
 and (Del). Any more(?). Hope not.
JRNL 07/20/95
Went to work. Started building B. Went to lunch with Chris
 & his dad.
Called Ben about campout. Its not Mt StHellens (DJ was
 wrong). Ben said that DJ and Ty decided not to go at the
 last minute. I'm tring to get ahold of them. Ill probably
 go to the scout meeting tonight though.
Went to meeting. Said I'd probably go but wasn't quite sure.
 Was going to have Sully call before he came to pick me up.
DJ called back. Decided to go to water slides with him and
 Ty. Mom wanted me to go to some church thing so I hoped
 that I could do both. Coul't find out for sure though
 because I was home alone.
 
 
 
JRNL 07/21/95
Saw it was cloudy and decided not to go water sliding but
 I'd go camping instead. Besides, I talked to Mom and I
 wouldn't be able to go to the church thing if I went water
 sliding anyway. I told her I would go camping and not with
 the girls to Pullman. She was upset but she let me go.
Sully came by at about 12. We picked up Ben and then started
 driving to Hanegan Peak where we would be hiking. We stoped
 to eat lunch and get some more food.
We hiked a little pass the place where we stayed last time
 (with Ben, DJ, and little Chris). We camped in another
 camp spot about two miles farther than before (about 6
 total miles). There was lots of bugs. We ate steak and
 cup of soups. After dark Ben and I started off to hike
 Hanegan Peak. All wa had was a head light. We got lost near
 the top and decided to go back. Played cards. Went to bed.
JRNL 07/22/95
Sleeping bag was wet and to many bugs. Got up after 3 hrs
 of sleep (2:30 to 5:30). Decided to come back a day early
 and not go to Copper lake. Hiked back. Drove to Bellingham.
 Showered at YMCA. Went to Pizza Hut. I was sick so I saved
 my share for later.
Got home and remembered I would be alone all day until the
 next day. Went to Cost Cutter and got seven movies.
 (Girl in the Swing, Robocop 3, Cyborg, Love Potion #9,
  Leathal Wepon 1, Life of Brian, Bev. Hills Cop 3).
Watched all moves except last one and ate pizza. Got to
 tired and Went to bed (at around 5:30a).
 
 
 
 
JRNL 07/23/95
Got up at 2pm. Finished watching last movie. Cooked a hotdog
 because all pizza was gone. Rewound all movies. I would
 take them back but I have no idea when they will be back.
 So I'm catching up on journals insteaed. All the movies
 were cool except Girl in the Swing which was a really cheap
 lame British film. Life of Brian was pretty cheap also but
 it was sort of funny.
Mom called. Said they wouldn't be back until at least 12
 or 1 in the morning.
Took movies back and rented Total Recall. Watched it.
Mom called again. The girls had arrived late and they would
 be back the next morning instead.
Went to bed at 12 because I had to work the next morning.
 
 
JRNL 07/24/95
Woke up at 7 with a headache. Called Grandma and told her to
 tell my boss Bill that I wouldn't be in today. Went back
 to sleep.
They came back at about 10:30am. I went back to sleep again.
Got up later and took a shower. Decided not to go to School
 of Truth with Mom & the girls. They would leave at 5:30p
 and would be gone until Saterday. Still need to take movie
 back. I should have gone to work because I would have been
 able to then.
After they left took movie ack and withdrew $100 from bank.
 I was going to mall and needed money just incase there
 was something cool. There wasn't.
Went to training with Dad. Last one.
Worked on J1.1. Found BIG problem with EofLineNum function.
 Can easily fix but it makes errors in the rest. Sucks.
JRNL 07/25/95
Went to work. Was a little late because Dad drove me. Bill
 said to try to be there by eight. Weeded by myself in the
 morning then went and helped Chris paint in building B.
 Dad forgot to give me lunch money so I called him and he
 picked me up for lunch. Went to DQ.
Came home and slept for a little in the afternoon and more
 after dinner. Didn't do much today. It rained all day.
Dad thought I was doing something 'bad' (?!) when I turned
 off screen before he bardged in. I just didn't want him to
 be nosy and look at what I was writing because I know thats
 what he'd do.
 
 
 
 
JRNL 07/26/95
Painted building B all day. Dad forgot lunch money again so
 I called him and he brought some food from DQ. Clock was
 loose on wall and fell when we painted. It broke pieces off
 the side.
Got home and started some Flash progra again. Got it to work
 finally. There wasn't a prayer meeting tonight so we rented
 Dumb & Dumber. It was pretty funny. Wasn't as lame as it
 looked in the previews.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
JRNL 07/27/95
Painted building B alone today. Chris was at DQ. Wasn't too
 boring. Had walkman and stuff. There was a pretty good
 looking girl always watching me today.
Called DJ to see what he was doing over the weekend. Ended
 up going over there. Us and Ty went to Dymands to play
 pool for a couple hours. Afterwards we stoped at the store
 because I wanted to check out sun glasses. I bought some
 cool little ones with blood red lenses. They made the
 sky look cool and stuff. Some of the green traffic lights
 turned light gray. Some green ones stayed the same.
Called Dad because I wanted to stay over the night. I would
 miss work the next day but it wouldnt matter because I
 usually don't work on Fridays.
Edited Doom levels all night. Ty had to go home at 10p.
 Made a level that was the inside of DJ's room/trailer.
JRNL 07/28/95
Got up at late at about 2. Worked on Doom levels for a
 while. Wanted to try changing graphics and guys but we
 needed Windows. It got erased on Ty's computer. We had DJ's
 dad take us to my house and get my computer. We had to link
 them to get it copied.
Tried to use WinTex, a program that was supposed to let you
 edit Doom graphics. We got it to pull sprites out of the
 Doom .WAD file and save them as .BMP files we could edit.
 We couldn't get it to put them back in after that though.
 We stayed up until about 3 trying to make them work. I got
 a headache and went to bed. I couldn't sleep and later I
 threw up outside.
 
 
 
JRNL 07/29/95
Got up feeling better. Headache was almost gone.
Figured out how to use DMGraph and it worked better than
 the other software. DJ and I made his head on a stick and
 some other graphics. Ty's mouse broke. Tried to fix it but
 I needed a soldering iron.
Ty came over. Showed game to him and Stan and then we spent
 the rest of the evening making Ty look cool in a picture
 taken when he worked in the cafeteria at school.
DJ and Ty played Ping Pong for an hour. Stan and I listened
 to music.
Ty took me home at 11:45. I was supposed to be back around
 11 but it didn't matter bacause Mom and Dad were at Pam
 & Gregs house. Amy Spurgen was over for the weekend with
 the girls. They all got back at about 4 that afternoon.
 
JRNL 07/30/95
Got up early for meeting at Aroyos. Mom wanted to walk to
 that school durring the meeting to talk about them going
 to Russia.
Went out to pizza at Little Caesars.
Spent the afternoon at Grandpa and Pats house. Read a book.
 We took a walk around a lake.
Went over to Grandmas. Will and Corey were there. Will had
 some baby crows.
Went home. Can't remember what happened after that.
 
 
 
 
 
 
JRNL 07/31/95
Went to work. Painted. Chris wasn't there. Called Mom
 because I didn't have any lunch money. We ate at the little
 Pizza Hut.
Mom and the girls left at 5 or 6 to go back to Truth School.
 I have to go down to Bellview on Thurs after work. Will
 stay for the weekend and see them and Grandma.
Was supposed to pick up computer at DJ's at 9. Dad was late
 and we got there at about 10:30. Tried to fix Ty's Windows
 but didn't have enough time. DJ showed some of the Doom
 guys he drew.
Chevron gave Dad $55 back instead of $45. Dad went back and
 gave it back.
 
 
 
JRNL 08/01/95
Went to work. Painted building B. Found out Chris won't be
 back all week because they need him at DQ.
Was some crash on the Guide right near the other side of
 Horton. Don't know who was killed though.
We were going to get a movie but Dad came in to late and I
 was to tired anyway.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
JRNL 08/02/95
Started painting building C. Had to move all the stuff to
 a storage room there.
Came home and worked on v2.0 of FakeDos. Finished it.
Dad went to the prayer meeting and then came home before he
 left to Bellview. He left at about 10:30p. He'll stay at
 Grandma's until tomorrow morning and then he'll fly
 somewhere. I can't remember excatly. He'll get back Sunday.
Wanted to get a movie at Cost Cutter and rode bike there
 after Dad left. Tried to rent a movie but they wouldn't let
 me for some reason. First they said I couldn't rent a rated
 R movie because I wasn't 17 yet. So I picked out another
 one. When the guy scanned my card he said he couldn't let
 me rent this one either because the computer said that no
 one under 18 could use that account. I've used that account
 before hundreds of times, even for 'rated R' movies. Sucks.
JRNL 08/03/95
Went to work. Had to get up by my self and ride my bike
 because everyone was gone. Painted in building C. Chris
 came back at about 11. We went to the mall at lunch and
 looked around MusicLand and HotTopics. Chris bought a
 blacklight poster and two gold hoop earrings. I told him
 to get a large one and a small one and wear them in the
 same hole.
Mom is supposed to come and pick me up sometime around 6:30.
 She isn't here yet. I'd take a shower but I don't know when
 she'll be here.
Got here around 7. She let me drive to Bellview. After we
 got there everyone was in bed except Grandma. Stayed up a
 little while and then went to bed.
 
 
JRNL 08/04/95
Got up early and went to the truth school. It wasn't very
 fun. Had no idea what was going on and didn't know anyone
 there.
Went back to Grandma's afterwards and had lunch. Amy Spurgen
 came with us to stay with the girls for the weekend. I had
 I headache from the meeting and slept most of the day. I
 got to sleep in the bedroom because I was sick (not the
 couch, Mom took it instead).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
JRNL 08/05/95
Slept in until almost 12. Got up and didn't do anything.
 Mom and the girls left to go to someones wedding at 1.
 Grandma left at 1 also to go to a birthday party. I stayed
 home and did nothing. Watched the Simpsons. After everyone
 got back grandma took me to go get something to eat at
 Arbies.
We watched the movie Big in the evening. After that everyone
 went to bed. I couldn't sleep. I stayed up for a few more
 hours reading some book of Grandmas about a girl that sees
 visions and tries to solve a murder. Didn't get very far.
 
 
 
 
 
JRNL 08/06/95
Got up and went to Seattle meeting. Picked up Dad at the
 airport afterwards. We ate at McDolanlds and went back to

 based. Have to be extra carefull and sand the walls a
 little also.
Chris and I went to the mall durring lunch. He got a sweat-
 shirt for his girlfriends birthday. I bororrowed $10 to
 get a poster of The Crow.
It was raining today. We're supposed to get a movie tonight
 so I hope Dad comes in in time to get one.
Remembered I hadn't seen The Crow for a long time so we got
 it. I don't think Dad liked it very much.
 
 
 
 
 
JRNL 08/08/95

Decided not to bother going to work since I'd just be
 working for a few hours. Picked up Grandmas car and
 followed Dad to the driving place. Waited in line for a
 while. We filled out some papers and then found out that
 I would have to wait for about a week to take the test
 because all the spots were filled. I have to go in on
 Tuesday the 22nd at 8:30a. Took grandmas car back.
Mowed the lawn and did dishes. Worked on Doom walls all
 day.

 half a day to make up anyway. Got up at 11 and had to
 mow the lawn for a while. Called DJ to see whats going on.
 Decided to go to Seattle because it might be cool there.
 Ty and DJ should be here any minute now.
They came at about 3. Thought it might be to late to go but
 we went anyway. Went to the Bellview Square but there was
 nothing to do there. Went to Seattle to look around and see
 if we could find a pizza place. Stoped at the Seatle Center
 for a while but didn't do anything. Drove around Seattle
 trying to find a place to eat but couldn't find any. Drove
 home at got to Bellingham in 45 mins (from Bothel). Stoped
 at Pizza Hut near Fred Meyer. Got a large pepperoini and a

 my new Cds.
 
 
 
 
 
 
JRNL 08/13/95
Went to the church meeting. It was at the people who have a
 new baby's house. They live about an hour away. There was
 a potluck afterwards. The girls wanted to go swimming at

 something instead.

Was too tired to go out fishing early in the morning. Got up
 around 10 and packed up. Dad checked out and we paddled
 around the lake in the canoe for a while. Then we left.
 Stoped to eat at Dairy Queen. Drove a while. Stoped to see
 some rafters cross a rapid part of the river. There were
 some people that had already crashed or something when we
 got out. Some lady was hurt or something and Dad had to
 give them a warm jacket while the ambulance got there. We
 didn't stop after that until we got home. Ben called and
 I have to be at the church at 10:15a tomorrow to go to Mt
 St Hellens. I have to go to the Franks with everyone later
 tonight to talk about them moving to Russia.
Only Dad decided to go to the Franks tonight. I sat around
 and read a book. Dad said they had probably decided to wait
 a while before they moved.
JRNL 08/19/95
Was going to get up early today but was too tired. Ate
 breakfast and went out on the boat. Fished for a while and
 then went around the lake for a while. It was a nicer day
 than before but there were still a few clouds. Didn't
 catch anything. Read a book for most of the day and played
 Monopoly in the evening. I was ahead for most of the game
 but somehow Dad won.

Went to work. Bill was back and I told him I would have to
 leave a little early today. I also asked him if I could
 take Monday through Wednesday off next week to go to Mt St
 Hellens. He said ok. Chris and I started painting the
 place where the stairs are in building C. It was almost
 impossible to get the celing taped because it was so high.
 Went to Sound Advice to take back the amp Chris bought for
 his car. He made a deal with the guy to build him a box
 and install the door speakers for the price of it.
Mom picked me up at 3. Went home and packed. Dad and I left
 for Canada at around 5:30 which was later then we wanted.
 We got there after the place closed but they left our cabin
 unlocked for us. We played poker for a while and went to
 bed.
 
JRNL 08/30/95
Got up. Went to work. Painted building C. Had some lunch
 left over from yesterday and some money.
Came home. Mom said she and the girls had seen a cool car
 that they thought I would like for $5500. Mom, Dad, and I
 went to see it. It was an '87 Pontiac Fiero in real nice
 cond. Decided I'd check into it and see if the owner would
 accept payments. I hope Dad can find a way to give me the
 $200 he owes me.
Read a book for a while. Cleaned room and did laundry.
1st day of school for Meridian (DJ, Ben). Fools.

 We had to go back to McDonalds to wash our hands. Chris

 to look at 8's for his truck. Listened to the speakers they
 had there and he decided to keep his 10's longer even
 though there wasn't evough air space.
Read or something all afternoon.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
JRNL 08/27/95
Family came and picked me up at about 10a. Went to meeting
 at MacGilveries. There was lunch afterwards.
Told Dad and Mom about Firebird. We went to go see it and
 for some reason they didn't like it. And I found out that
 Dad wouldn't be able to cosign to finance a car anyway
 because his credit was bad (bankrupt). They also said it
 would be rude to ask Grandma to cosign and she probably
 wouldn't be able to qualify either.
Was mad all day. Now I'll probably have to wait forever to
 get a decent car.
 
 
 
 
 
JRNL 08/26/95
Got up at about 12. Ty got up early for some reason. Watched
 commercials on TV for a while. DJ had to go to the doctors
 at 1:30. Ty, Stan and I went to the mall and played video
 games. Also went to the Chevy dealer because Stan had seen
 a Ford Probe he wanted to look at. Came back to pick up DJ.
 Went to place in Lynden to look at Firebird and ask its
 price. The guy said 12000 and that it was a '92 and a V6.
 We went to the Lynden library to check out how much it was
 supposed to be worth. About thay much. Went back to DJs.
 Ty went home. Went to McDonalds (DJ, Stan, Ives, Me) to
 pick up dinner. Looked at some dealerships in Lynden for
 a while. Called home later that night. They said I could
 stay until the morning because of the meeting.
 
 
JRNL 08/25/95
Went to work. Painted building C. Went to the mall for
 lunch. John Ashton was there with two girls. Was going to
 eat with them but we were to covered with paint and decided
 we didn't want to be seen. Went to McDonalds drive thru
 instead.
Came home. Called DJ. Was going to over there at 7. Had to
 mow the lawn first. They came by at 7 even though Mom was
 going to take me. I wanted to see the Firebird in Lynden
 that Chris had told me about. Looked at that. It was cool,
 nice teal color, looked pretty new, T-Top, nice wheels/
 tires, good stereo, etc. Was closed ao could ask about it.
 Went to look at a Corvett Stingray that Ty and DJ said they
 saw. Went to the guys house and talked to him. It was only
 $9900 but since the insurance was so high I couldn't afford
 it. Rented two movies. Spent the night.
JRNL 08/24/95
Went to work. Chris wasn't there hope he wasn't in jail

Had to get up early because stupid Vince wanted to leave.
 His moter home was having electrical problems again and he
 couldn't watch TV. Got food at McDonalds. Went to Mt St
 Hellens place and watched a movie about it. Was dumb. Rode

Got home and Grandma was here. Mom brought some coffee candy
 from where ever she and Dad had gone. Sat around and read.
 Have to go to work tomorrow.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
JRNL 08/22/95
Got up and got ready to hike. Drove to the mountain. Started
 hiking. Went through trees, then rocks, then ash at the
 top. Ty got there first, then Sully, then me, then Ben and
 DJ. I was with Ben and DJ until the very end, halfway
 through the ash. They still got to the top half an hour
 after I did. Saw some girl comming down who looked pretty
 fine. Came by her again a couple times when we hiked down.
 Could tell she thought I was cool because she would always
 look at me and smile, and look away when I noticed. Got
 down and played White Zombie in the van. It was cool until
 Vince came marching out of his moter home and started
 yelling and screaming and cussing. We got pissed off and
 almost killed him. He decided not to let us go to the Ape
 Caves or eat dinner. We had to camp in the lame RV park
 again. Took showers and played poker.
JRNL 08/21/95
Was supposed to be picked up at 11 but Vince decided to go
 (hurray.) and Sully got cought in a traffic jam. Left at
 2:30 instead. Ate dinner at Arbies. Got batteries for
 CD player I brought. Got to RV park after dark. We wanted
 to build a fire but stupid Vince wouldn't let us. We had to
 go to bed at 10 but we couldn't sleep because it sucked.
 Ty left to go sleep on top of the picnic table because it
 was more comfortable. Ben, DJ, and I didn't get to sleep
 until 4:30 in the morning.
 
 
 
 
 
 
JRNL 08/31/95

 forever to get new paint so had to sit around forever.
 Had a Lunchable that Mom packed.
Theres supposed to be a scout meeting tonight.
DJ and Ty were supposed to pick me up but they were late.
 Stan came too beacuse he was bored. We had to pick up Ben.
 Talked about what we were going to do this winter and Sully
 wants me to find out how much a ski trip will cost.
We went to look at cars afterwards. Looked at Ford Probes
 (for Stan) and stoped by to look at the Fiero I want.
Ty stayed the night.
 
 
 
 
JRNL 09/05/95
Went to work. Painted building C. Am almost done.
Went with Mom to get job applications at Burger King and
 Dairy Queen.
Dad said he talked to the guy who was selling the Fiero.
 The guy said he would probably accept payments on the car.
 It looks like it might work out. Dad will probably call
 again tonight and work something out.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
JRNL 09/01/95
Ty and I got up early to take DJ to school. Afterwards we
 drove around looking for job applications. Filled a few
 out. Went to Payless Drug and they said we could have an
 interview later that day at 2:00.
Went back to school at lunch even though Mom stupidly
 thought we wern't allowed there durring the day. (If that
 was true, why did the principal say it was ok and the
 school have given Ty a free lunch ticket?).
Went to Payless. I had my interview first cause I had my
 app. filled out. Ty went next. They said they would call

Got up at 11. It was hot. We wanted to go swimming. Ty,
 DJ, and me went to some gravel pit lake to swim but it
 was too cold. We decided to go to the new pool that they
 built in Bellingham. We went there and stayed until 6:30.
 Went to my house (no one was home, they were in Seattle)
 and changed clothes and ate some food. We went to the mall
 afterwards. Went back to DJ's house. Called Mom at 11 and
 she said she wanted me to come home.

Got up at 11. Called DJ. Didn't have a way to get there so
 I went to the bus stop. Waited about half an hour before
 I remembered that it was a holiday and the busses wouldn't
 run. Had to go home and get my bike.
Watched Childs Play 3 at DJs. Ty called and wanted to do
 something. Decided to go to a movie. He came by and we got
 Stan and picked up Lacey. Went to the mall but there were
 no good movies. Went to Sunset and got tickets to
 Waterworld. Started at 7:15 and it was only 5:30. Played
 pool at Dymonds till then. Saw the movie. It was pretty
 cool. Went back to DJ's and called Mom. She came and picked
 me up.

Went to work. Painted. Chris came by at around 3:30. He had
 a new system in his truck. Sounded cool. It only had one
 8 and two door speakers but the 8 was in some special box
 that cost about $200.
Called DJ to see if his stepdad would look at the car I
 want. He said he would if we could bring it by. Dad called
 the guy who ownes it but he was busy and we'll do it
 tomorrow.
Had to mow the lawn. Mom, Dad, Mary went to prayer meeting.

Got up to practice driving before the driving test at 10.
 Took the test. Didn't pass bacause the lady said I didn't
 use the turn signal for a left turn once which wasn't true.
 She wasn't paying very close attantion the whole time. Have
 it reseceduled for next Friday.
Went back to work painting curbs. Grandma took me back home.
Called DJ to see whats going on tonight. Might go to the
 football game and then the dance.
Got droped off at the school at 7:15. Waited there with Ty
 for everyone to show up. About half an hour later they
 came (Stan, Laey, DJ, Tyler). Decided to go to the Ferndale
 game instead. Stayed there for a while. Ty got bored and
 left by himself and went home. The rest of us drove around
 and went to Burger King and stuff. Came back to DJs house
 and everyone stayed the night (exept Lacey).

Got up. Mom took me to work. She did registration there
 today. I painted red around the doorways of building A.
 Also put in lights in the ceiling and cleaned up chairs in
 a room in building B. Chris came by. Said he was quiting
 there. Maybe I'll get more hours now.

Cool. I haven't typed one of these in a long time. There's
a lot of snow. Had to go to work at Burger King at 12. Dad
had to take me because it was icy/snowy and I didn't want to
mess up my car. (I bought an '87 Pontiac Fiero in Augest or
September or something.)
