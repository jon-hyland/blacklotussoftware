DOS Applications Disk Readme

There are seven DOS applications I wrote a long time ago on this disk.  They will not run on Windows NT but they should in Windows 95/98.  The best way to run them is to shut-down to MS-DOS and run them from the command prompt.  All the original source code is included on this disk.  There are two versions of Block Cruncher (Tetris) on this disk.  Version 1.2 was written in Turbo Pascal, and the version 2.0LE was completely rewritten in Borland C++.  It looks and acts exactly the same, but it is a completely different program.  All the other things on this disk were written in Pascal.


Whats Included:

Block Cruncher - A color Tetris-like game with sound effects, high-score list, in-program help document, many options.  1997.  1998.

Worm Bomb - A game similar to QBasic Nibbles.  Color, /w sounds, high-score list.  Your worm picks up coins while avoiding bombs and electric fence.  1996.

Cool Draw - A design utility to draw color ANSI screens.  Used by me for designing graphics for most the games on this disk.  1995-1996.

Crazy 8's - A color card game you play against the computer.  Animated.  1994.

Text Crypt - Used to encrypt text files.  Generates new encryption scheme for every character it encounters.  Encryption scheme modified later for other apps such as Binary Crypt (B.C. (c) 1999-2000 Black Lotus Software).  1996.

Creature Race - Simple game where you bet on a "horse" for money.  1996.

Deluxe Bug Zapper - A stress-relieving DOS screen saver.  Colorful bugs fly around the screen and get fried as they are attracted into the electric bug-zapper.  1997.
